# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# This Dockerfile performs a multi-stage build and must be built with BuildKit: `docker buildx build .`.
# By default, it will produce an optimized image with the production build, served as static content with nginx.
# Target the development stage to produce a larger dev image running Vite dev server. Good for Skaffold/file sync.
