= Alert Severities
:description: Find out the types of alert severities OpenNMS Lōkahi/Cloud uses.

Lōkahi uses the following alert severities:

* *Critical:* A number of devices on the monitored network are affected by an alert.
Anyone who can should focus on fixing the alert's root cause.
* *Major:* A device is completely down or in danger of going down.
* *Minor:* A portion of a device (a service, an interface, a power supply, and so on) has stopped functioning.
* *Warning:* An alert has occurred that requires attention.
This severity can also indicate a condition that should be logged, but that does not require direct action.
* *Cleared:* An alert with a self-clearing error condition has been corrected and service is restored.
* *Indeterminate:* No severity could be associated with the alert.
