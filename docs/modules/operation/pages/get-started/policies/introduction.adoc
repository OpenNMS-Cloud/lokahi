= Monitoring Policies
:description: Learn how monitoring policies in OpenNMS Lōkahi/Cloud can define a set of rules for monitoring nodes and taking action under certain conditions.

A monitoring policy defines a set of rules for monitoring nodes and automatically taking action under certain conditions (for example, sending alerts), and the notification type for those alerts (email or PagerDuty).

==  Tags, monitoring policies, and nodes

A tag is an optional label (for example, `router`) that you can associate with nodes and monitoring policies that allows for easy and flexible filtering and grouping of devices.

OpenNMS assigns the `default` tag to all nodes identified through the xref:operation:get-started/discovery/introduction.adoc[discovery process].
Users can remove this tag or add other tags to the node (see xref:inventory/nodes.adoc#tag-create[Create tags and add them to a node]), depending on how they want to set up their system.

== Default monitoring policy

By default, OpenNMS Cloud/Lōkahi starts monitoring the system when it discovers nodes.
This is because the discovery process automatically assigns the `default` tag to all discovered nodes, and the default monitoring policy includes a `default` tag.

The default monitoring policy creates alerts for devices that are offline, coming back online, unreachable, or whose service has been restored.

As you customize Lōkahi/Cloud for your own monitoring requirements, you may choose to add/remove node tags from nodes or the default monitoring policy, or create new monitoring policies.

== Before you begin

Make sure you have done the following before you create a monitoring policy:

* Performed at least one xref:get-started/discovery/active.adoc[discovery].
* Created xref:inventory/nodes.adoc#tag-create[tags] for the nodes you are monitoring.
