## Vuex state management
This project uses [Vuex](https://next.vuex.vuejs.org/) with the modules pattern.
Each store module has separate files for state, actions, and mutations.
Current convention is to only call actions from components, (no mutations).

## Vue-router
Project routes make use of [vue-router](https://next.router.vuejs.org/guide/)


## Prettier
Formatting should use the .prettierrc file. For VSCode, install the Prettier extension, go to the IDE Settings and set this formatter to take precedence.

### Use `<script setup>`

[`<script setup>`](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/227). To get proper IDE support for the syntax, use [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar).
