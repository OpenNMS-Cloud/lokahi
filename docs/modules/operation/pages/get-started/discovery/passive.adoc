:description: Learn how to identify network inventory with OpenNMS L≈çkahi/Cloud using SNMP traps (passive discovery).

A xref:get-started/discovery/introduction.adoc#passive-discovery[passive discovery] is one method to identify the devices on your network and add them to your monitoring inventory.
You may also choose to xref:get-started/discovery/active.adoc[create an active discovery].

NOTE: Passive discovery works only with Minions running on Linux.

You can create only one passive discovery:

. Choose *Discovery* in the left navigation menu.
. On the Discovery page, click *Add Discovery*.
. In the Passive Discovery area, click *SNMP Traps*.
. Fill in the appropriate information in each field.

NOTE: To create xref:inventory/nodes.adoc#tag-create[tags], type a name for the tag in the *Tags* field, and click on the name when it appears in the drop-down list.
The new tag appears below the field and is available for use elsewhere, such as with nodes and alerts.

. Click *Save Discovery*.

The name of the passive discovery you created appears in the My Passive Discoveries list.
Click the *toggle on* button to perform discovery on the selected node.
