:description: Learn how to identify network inventory with OpenNMS L≈çkahi/Cloud using ICMP/SNMP or Azure (active discovery).

An xref:get-started/discovery/introduction.adoc#active-discovery[active discovery] is one method to identify the devices on your network and add them to your monitoring inventory.
You may also choose to xref:get-started/discovery/passive.adoc[create a passive discovery].

You can create a number of active discoveries to cover different areas of your network.

The discovery runs as soon as you save it, and every 24 hours thereafter.
There is continuous polling and data collection every minute.

To create an active discovery, follow these steps:

. Choose *Discovery* in the left navigation menu.
. On the Discovery page, click *Add Discovery*.
. In the Active Discovery area, choose one of the following:
    * ICMP/SNMP: Performs a ping sweep and scans for SNMP MIBs on nodes that respond to the ping sweep.
    * Azure: Connects to the Azure API, queries the virtual machines list, and creates entities for each virtual machine (VM) in the node inventory.
+
. Fill in the appropriate information in each field.
.. The community string is used to access device statistics.
.. The UDP port is the port on which SNMP operates.
+
NOTE: To create xref:inventory/nodes.adoc#tag-create[tags], type a name for the tag in the *Tags* field, and click on the name when it appears in the drop-down list.
The new tag appears below the field and is available for use elsewhere, such as with nodes and alerts.

. Click *Save Discovery*.

A dialog appears from which you can opt to add another discovery or view the nodes detected from the discovery.

The name of the active discovery you created appears in the My Active Discoveries list.
