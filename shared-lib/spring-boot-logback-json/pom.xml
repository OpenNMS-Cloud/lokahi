    <!-- Since we need to support a few different versions of Spring Boot,
             we don't include spring-boot-starter-logging since we can't specify
             its version here. It is the default logger, anyway, so we should
             be fine. -->
    <!-- The same goes for logback-classic and logback-core. We don't add
             these directly here so we don't conflict with what is in
             spring-boot-starter-logging. Also avoiding this in rest-server tests:
