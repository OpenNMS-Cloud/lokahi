:description: Learn about the types of visualizations available in OpenNMS L≈çkahi/Cloud: insights dashboard, top 10 applications and talkers, total network traffic, and maps.

The Insights Dashboard is the home page for your Horizon Stream instance.
It displays statistics and visualizations that represent the current state of your monitored network.
You can also see data visualizations on the xref:operation:flows/introduction.adoc[flows page], and on a per node basis by clicking the events/alarms icon on any node in your inventory.

== Statistics and visualizations

The Insights Dashboard displays the following statistics and visualizations:

* *Alert Status:* Number of alerts of each status (Critical, Major, and so on) and their incidence rate compared to the average for the selected time period (for example, "-15% Past 24 Hours").
* *Total Network Traffic:* A graph of inbound and outbound network traffic over the selected time period.
* *Top 10 Applications:* A graph displaying the top 10 most used applications in your monitored network over the selected time period.
* *Top 10 Talkers:* A graph displaying the top 10 most active applications in your monitored network over the selected time period.

By default, information is shown for the last 24 hours.

== View data on a per-node basis

If you are using SNMP, you can view rate of traffic observed on a given interface through the Inventory page on a per-node basis:

. Choose *Inventory* in the left navigation menu.
. Click the *Events/Alarms* symbol on the node whose flows data you want to see.

. Click the *graphs* symbol beside an interface in the SNMP interfaces area to view traffic graphs.
. Click the browser back button or an item in the left navigation menu to exit the details screen.

== Shortcuts

The Insights Dashboard includes shortcuts for the following functions through the *Quick Actions* button:

* *Add Discovery:* Create a new xref:get-started/discovery/active.adoc[active] or xref:get-started/discovery/passive.adoc[passive discovery].
* *Add Monitoring Policy:* Define a new xref:get-started/policies/create.adoc[monitoring policy].
* *View Flows:* View visualizations of flows data collected from your monitored network.

You can also view inventory by clicking the *inventory* link on the Total Network Traffic graph, and view flows by clicking the *flows* link on the Top 10 Applications graph.

[[geo-map]]
= Geographical Map

The *Map* page displays the geolocation of your Minion(s) on a world map, and indicates the number of nodes associated with it.
You can zoom in and out for a more granular view of node geolocations.

You must define an address or geo-coordinates for the monitoring location in order for nodes to display on the map.
