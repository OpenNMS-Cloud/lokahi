= Create a Monitoring Policy

A monitoring policy uses tags and rules to customize the type of monitoring data that you collect and the notifications you receive about that data.

To create a monitoring policy, follow these steps:

. Choose *Monitoring Policies* in the left navigation menu.
. Click *+ New Policy** or *Add*.
. Type a name for the policy.
. In the *Memo* box, type details about the policy you might want as a reference (for example, its basic use case).
. (Optional) Select the types of notifications that you want to receive for any alerts.
. \<Instructions box>
. Add xref:inventory/nodes.adoc#tag-create[tags] to categorize the policy.
. To add a rule to the policy, click *Add* or *+New Rule*.
. Specify the *Name*, *Component Type*, and *Detection Method*.
. Click *Save Rule*.
. \<Save Policy button?>

TBD: multiple rules per policy? Guidelines around conflicts with rules. Does saving a rule save the policy (not clear from prototype).
