:description: Learn about alerts in OpenNMS L≈çkahi/Cloud.

Alerts represent potential and actual problems in your monitored network.
Your environment's xref:get-started/policies/introduction.adoc[monitoring policies] define the conditions under which alerts are generated.

The xref:visualizations/introduction.adoc[Insights Dashboard] displays a summary of alerts over the past 24 hours.
For more detailed insights into your network's alerts, including the monitoring policies that defined them, select *Alerts* in the left navigation menu.

For information about severities, see xref:reference:severities.adoc[Alert Severities].

*Benefits:* You do not have to sift through a lot of information to see which nodes require attention; you can simply review alerts of different severities.

== Before you begin

Before OpenNMS can generate alerts, you must configure the following:

* Your xref:get-started/discovery/introduction.adoc[network discovery] settings.
* (Optional) At least one monitoring policy.
** If you do not want to configure a policy immediately, you can use the xref:get-started/policies/introduction.adoc#default-monitoring-policy[default monitoring policy] instead.
