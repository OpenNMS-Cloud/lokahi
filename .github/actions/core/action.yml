        #mvn clean install
        # For testing the pipeline, just run this without tests to get the

        # 5mins roughly.
        # Release on 0.0.0 for now.

        # Full build, including docker image creation and Integration Tests
        mvn -Prun-it clean install
        # Ran test, worked, took about 5mins.

        # How do we trigger the unit tests?

        #docker images
        # The image, opennms-horizon-application-it-image, is just for the
        # integration tests, ignore.
