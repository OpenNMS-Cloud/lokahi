= Create a Monitoring Policy
:description: Learn how to create a monitoring policy in OpenNMS L≈çkahi/Cloud to define a set of rules for monitoring nodes and taking action under certain conditions.

A monitoring policy uses tags and rules to customize the type of monitoring data that you collect and the notifications you receive about that data.

Note that you can also create a monitoring policy by copying an existing one and editing it.
Click the policy, then click the *copy* symbol at the top right of the *Policy Name* .

To create a monitoring policy, follow these steps:

. Choose *Monitoring Policies* in the left navigation menu.
. Click *New Policy*.
. Type a name for the policy.
. In the *Memo* box, type details about the policy you might want as a reference (for example, its basic use case).
. (Optional) Select the type of notifications that you want to receive for any alerts.
. Add xref:inventory/nodes.adoc#tag-create[tags] to include in the policy.
.. Select an existing tag from the drop-down list, or type a name and click *New* to create a tag.
+
This policy will apply to any nodes that have the same tags.
. To add a rule to the policy, click *New Rule*, on the bottom left of the page.
+
A rule specifies the conditions under which OpenNMS generates alerts.
Rules are available only with the policy in which they were created.

. Set the criteria that will trigger an alert.
. Specify the name, component type, detection method, and event type to include.
. Set the criteria that will trigger an alert.
.. To include multiple criteria, click *Additional Conditions*.
. Click *Save Rule*.
. Click *Save Policy*.
