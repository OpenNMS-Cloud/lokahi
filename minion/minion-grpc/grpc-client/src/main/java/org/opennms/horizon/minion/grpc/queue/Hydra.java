 * A multi-headed queue.

 * A hydra consists of a global queue and multiple sub-queues. Pushing elements to a hydra is always done using a
 * sub-queue. The added elements will then be added to the sub-queue and the global queue. Taking elements from a
 * sub-queue will also remove that element from the global queue, even if they are not at the head of the global queue.
 * In addition, the global queue can be polled for elements. Elements directly taken from the global queue will still
 * remain in the sub-queue which have been used to enqueue that element.
