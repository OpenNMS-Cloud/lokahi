= Set up Notifications through PagerDuty
:description: Learn how to set up notifications through PagerDuty for OpenNMS Lōkahi/Cloud.

Instead of using the Lōkahi UI to view notifications, you can receive them as they occur via PagerDuty.

. Create a new https://www.pagerduty.com/[PagerDuty] account.
. Go to **Services**, and create a new integration for `Events API V2`.

. Go to the settings for the integration, and retrieve the integration key.

. In Lōkahi, click *Appliances>Outbound Notification*, and add your PagerDuty integration key.
. Select *Monitoring Policies* in the left navigation menu.
. Make sure you have a monitoring policy with notifications configured via PagerDuty.
+
NOTE: The default monitoring policy does not work for this, so you'll need to xref:get-started/policies/create.adoc[create a new monitoring policy].

. When a notification that matches the monitoring policy occurs, a new incident in PagerDuty will also be created.
