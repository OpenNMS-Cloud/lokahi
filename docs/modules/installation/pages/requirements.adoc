= Requirements

OpenNMS Lōkahi uses PostgreSQL as a relational database for its inventory and configuration, and big data systems such as Cortex and Elasticsearch for persistence of historical monitoring data.

Our current goal is that you can develop and run Lōkahi on a development system on the following platforms:

* Linux x86 (`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`)
* Darwin x86 (`x86_64-apple-darwin`)
* Darwin arm (1aarch64-apple-darwin1)

Lōkahi requires a Kubernetes-compatible infrastructure for deploying the application.

For installation instructions, see the https://github.com/OpenNMS-Cloud/lokahi/wiki/Getting-Started---Admin[administrator's getting started guide] in the project's wiki on GitHub.
