  Scenario: Verify when a thresholding event is received from Kafka, a new alert is only created on passing the threshold
    Then Send event with UEI "uei.opennms.org/generic/traps/SNMP_Cold_Start" with tenant "thresholdTenantA" with node 10
    Then Verify alert topic has 0 messages with tenant "thresholdTenantA"
    Then Send event with UEI "uei.opennms.org/generic/traps/SNMP_Cold_Start" with tenant "thresholdTenantA" with node 10
    Then Verify alert topic has 0 messages with tenant "thresholdTenantA"
    Then Send event with UEI "uei.opennms.org/generic/traps/SNMP_Cold_Start" with tenant "thresholdTenantA" with node 10
    Then List alerts for tenant "thresholdTenantA", with timeout 15000ms, until JSON response matches the following JSON path expressions
      | alerts.size() == 1 |
      | alerts[0].counter == 1 |
      | alerts[0].severity == MAJOR |
    Then Verify alert topic has 1 messages with tenant "thresholdTenantA"

  Scenario: Verify when a thresholding event is received from Kafka, a new alert is only created on passing the threshold within the timeframe
    Then Send event with UEI "uei.opennms.org/generic/traps/SNMP_Cold_Start" with tenant "thresholdTenantB" with node 10 at 15 minutes ago
    Then Verify alert topic has 0 messages with tenant "thresholdTenantB"
    Then Send event with UEI "uei.opennms.org/generic/traps/SNMP_Cold_Start" with tenant "thresholdTenantB" with node 10 at 7 minutes ago
    Then Verify alert topic has 0 messages with tenant "thresholdTenantB"
    Then Send event with UEI "uei.opennms.org/generic/traps/SNMP_Cold_Start" with tenant "thresholdTenantB" with node 10 at 3 minutes ago
    Then Verify alert topic has 0 messages with tenant "thresholdTenantB"
    Then Send event with UEI "uei.opennms.org/generic/traps/SNMP_Cold_Start" with tenant "thresholdTenantB" with node 10 at 2 minutes ago
    Then List alerts for tenant "thresholdTenantB", with timeout 5000ms, until JSON response matches the following JSON path expressions
      | alerts.size() == 1 |
      | alerts[0].counter == 1 |
      | alerts[0].severity == MAJOR |
    Then Verify alert topic has 1 messages with tenant "thresholdTenantB"

  Scenario: Verify when a thresholding event with no time limit is received from Kafka, a new alert is only created on passing the threshold
    Then Send event with UEI "uei.opennms.org/generic/traps/SNMP_Link_Down" with tenant "thresholdTenantF" with node 10
    Then Verify alert topic has 0 messages with tenant "thresholdTenantF"
    Then Send event with UEI "uei.opennms.org/generic/traps/SNMP_Link_Down" with tenant "thresholdTenantF" with node 10
    Then List alerts for tenant "thresholdTenantF", with timeout 15000ms, until JSON response matches the following JSON path expressions
      | alerts.size() == 1 |
      | alerts[0].counter == 1 |
      | alerts[0].severity == MAJOR |
    Then Verify alert topic has 1 messages with tenant "thresholdTenantF"


  Scenario: Verify a thresholded alert can be cleared by other events
    Then Send event with UEI "uei.opennms.org/generic/traps/SNMP_Link_Down" with tenant "thresholdTenantG" with node 10
    Then Verify alert topic has 0 messages with tenant "thresholdTenantG"
    Then Send event with UEI "uei.opennms.org/generic/traps/SNMP_Link_Down" with tenant "thresholdTenantG" with node 10
    Then List alerts for tenant "thresholdTenantG", with timeout 15000ms, until JSON response matches the following JSON path expressions
      | alerts.size() == 1 |
      | alerts[0].counter == 1 |
      | alerts[0].severity == MAJOR |
    Then Send event with UEI "uei.opennms.org/generic/traps/SNMP_Link_Up" with tenant "thresholdTenantG" with node 10
    Then List alerts for tenant "thresholdTenantG", with timeout 5000ms, until JSON response matches the following JSON path expressions
      | alerts.size() == 1            |
      | alerts[0].counter == 2        |
      | alerts[0].severity == CLEARED |

  Scenario: Verify a thresholded alert can be cleared by other events, and then recreated
    Then Send event with UEI "uei.opennms.org/generic/traps/SNMP_Link_Down" with tenant "thresholdTenantH" with node 10
    Then Verify alert topic has 0 messages with tenant "thresholdTenantH"
    Then Send event with UEI "uei.opennms.org/generic/traps/SNMP_Link_Down" with tenant "thresholdTenantH" with node 10
    Then List alerts for tenant "thresholdTenantH", with timeout 5000ms, until JSON response matches the following JSON path expressions
      | alerts.size() == 1 |
      | alerts[0].counter == 1 |
      | alerts[0].severity == MAJOR |
    Then Send event with UEI "uei.opennms.org/generic/traps/SNMP_Link_Up" with tenant "thresholdTenantH" with node 10
    Then List alerts for tenant "thresholdTenantH", with timeout 5000ms, until JSON response matches the following JSON path expressions
      | alerts.size() == 1            |
      | alerts[0].counter == 2        |
      | alerts[0].severity == CLEARED |
    Then Send event with UEI "uei.opennms.org/generic/traps/SNMP_Link_Down" with tenant "thresholdTenantH" with node 10
    Then List alerts for tenant "thresholdTenantH", with timeout 5000ms, until JSON response matches the following JSON path expressions
      | alerts.size() == 1 |
      | alerts[0].counter == 3 |
      | alerts[0].severity == MAJOR |
