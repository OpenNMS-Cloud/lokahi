:description: Learn about the types of visualizations available in OpenNMS L≈çkahi/Cloud: insights dashboard, top 10 applications and talkers, top nodes, total network traffic, and maps.

The insights dashboard displays statistics and visualizations that represent the current state of your monitored network.

It also provides quick links to the xref:operation:inventory/introduction.adoc[inventory] and xref:operation:flows/introduction.adoc[flows] pages for additional data visualizations.

== Statistics and visualizations

The Insights Dashboard displays the following statistics and visualizations:

* *Alert Summary:* Number of alerts of each status (Critical, Major, and so on) and their incidence rate compared to the average for the selected time period (for example, "-15% Past 24 Hours").
* *Node Reachability*: Percentage of nodes that OpenNMS can see and that respond to communication (ping, and so on).
* *Top Nodes*: A sortable list of the most active monitored nodes on your network.
* *Total Network Traffic:* A graph of inbound and outbound network traffic over the selected time period.
* *Top 10 Applications:* A graph displaying the top 10 most used applications in your monitored network over the selected time period.

By default, information is shown for the last 24 hours.

== View data on a per-node basis

If you are using SNMP, you can view rate of traffic observed on a given interface through the Inventory page on a per-node basis:

. Choose *Inventory* in the left navigation menu.
. Click the *Events/Alarms* symbol on the node whose flows data you want to see.

. Click the *graphs* symbol beside an interface in the SNMP interfaces area to view traffic graphs.
. Click the browser back button or an item in the left navigation menu to exit the details screen.

== Shortcuts

The Insights Dashboard includes shortcuts for the following:

* The *Inventory* link on the Total Network Traffic graph navigates users to the Network Inventory page.
* The *Flows* link on the Top 10 Applications graph navigates users to the Flows page.

[[geo-map]]
== Geographical Map

The *Map* page displays the geolocation of your Minion(s) on a world map, and indicates the number of nodes associated with it.

You must define a physical address or geo-coordinates (latitude and longitude) for the monitoring location to display nodes on the map. (See xref:minions/introduction.adoc#create-location[Create a location].)
